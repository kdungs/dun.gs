## This website
On this personal website/blog, I want to share some experiences from my life that I think might be useful for a non-zero fraction of this world's population. This site is written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), generated by [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) (which is itself written in [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/) and utilises the all-mighty [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) for parsing), and hosted on the servers of the German company [Uberspace](https://uberspace.de/). For a clean CSS base, [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) is used. The fonts are "Source Sans Pro" and "Source Code Pro" created by Adobe and hosted by Google.

## Some words about me
I study physics with a focus on experimental high-energy particle physics at TU Dortmund University. My Bachelor's thesis was about "Studies on Flavour-Tagging-Calibration with B<sup>0</sup> → Dπ candidates at the LHCb-Experiment". At the same experiment, I am currently working towards a Master's degree. Afterwards, I plan to do a PhD in said field. When I'm not working or programming, I like to do sports (running, fitness, football, …), read, cook, or spend time with friends.

### Preferences
I already mentioned Python, C++, and Haskell as my favourite programming languages (in that order). When it comes to the religious question of which editor to choose, I have to confess being a Vim-person. I use Mac OS for my daily work, but I'm equally fond of Linux. [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/) is my favourite distribution. I prefer Zsh over Bash and git over any other SCM. I love both coffee and tea.
