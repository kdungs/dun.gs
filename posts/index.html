<p>Thanks to the recent Steam Pirate Sale and my friend Alex, I started playing Windward. For technical reasons, we had to set up a dedicated server which turned out to be fairly simple and has the added benefit of asynchronous play that since then lured in more players (shout out to Patrick!).</p>

<p>Keyboards are a fascinating topic. We interact with them on a daily basis without the need for a deep understanding of how they work. I consider myself a keyboard enthusiast, yet, I had never built one myself.</p>

  <p><p>This is a follow-up to a post from last year called <a href="https://dun.gs/posts/groups-templates/">Simple group structures via templates in C++</a> in which we implemented a compile-time O(1) group structure.  Now we want to revisit the code and use a nice pattern that can be learned in “C++ Template Metaprogramming: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques from Boost and Beyond” by Abrahams and Gurtovoy.</p>

  <p><p><a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a> is <strong>the</strong> tool when it comes to collaborative work. <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> with its nice UI and its mechanism of <em>forking</em> and <em>pull requests</em> can boost a team's productivity even more. Unfortunately, there isn't just one way to get things done with Git and GitHub. Here I present an approach to working with pull requests that has proven to cause little friction if done correctly. </p>

  <p><p>If you enjoyed the previous post on Simple Higher Order Functions in C++ you already got a taste of templates in C++. In this post we have a look at how we can implement compile-time <em>groups</em> in C++11. If you are unfamiliar with the concept of groups, you can read about them on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_%28mathematics%29">Wikipedia</a> or <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Group.html">Wolfram MathWold</a>.</p>

  <p><p>Here is a question from a friend of mine that I will try to answer in this post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have the problem that I want to pass a function to a function. Until now, I have used <code>std::function</code> but I know there is also the possibility of function pointers and also you said something about templates and who knows what else. The question is of course: What's the difference and what is best?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In technical terms the question is: &quot;How do <strong>higher-order functions</strong> work in C++ and which way to implement them is recommended?&quot;. I will examine the problem in two steps and then discuss the alternatives.</p>

  <p><p>Today, I had some time to play around with <a href="https://libgit2.github.com">libgit2</a>, an excellent C-library for <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>. But since I was thinking about using it together with the freshly released <a href="https://github.com/facebook/proxygen">Proxygen</a>, the fast HTTP-framework from Facebook, I wanted to use the library functions from C++ from the start.</p>
<p>This was a perfect opportunity to play around with C++ memory management objects in the context of a C-library.</p>

  <p><p>In particle physics, when it comes to data analysis, <a href="http://root.cern.ch/">CERN's <code>ROOT</code></a> often is the tool of choice. It is a big and powerful framework that can do a lot of magical things. In this post, I don't want to discuss its advantages or disadvantages but rather explain how I install it on Mac OS and why I do so.</p>
