My personal website/blog. This repository contains the [Zola](http://getzola.org/) configuration and the raw markdown files.

This is also the place to discuss the articles. You can find all discussions [in the issues, under the "discussion" label](https://github.com/kdungs/dun.gs/labels/discussion).
