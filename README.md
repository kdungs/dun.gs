My personal website/blog. This repository contains the
[Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) configuration and the raw markdown files.

This is also the place to discuss the articles. You can find all discussions
[in the issues, under the "discussion"
label](https://github.com/kdungs/dun.gs/labels/discussion).
