My name is Kevin. I'm a physics student from Dortmund, Germany currently working on a master thesis at <abbr title="European Organization for Nuclear Research">CERN</abbr> with the <abbr title="Large Hadron Collider Beauty">LHCb</abbr> experiment.

Together with [Igor](http://babushk.in), [Tadej](http://tano.si), and [GÃ¡bor](https://github.com/gbiro), I created [Particle Clicker](http://particle-clicker.web.cern.ch), an educational game about particle physics research.
