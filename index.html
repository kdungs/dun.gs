Hi and welcome to my personal website/blog. It is very nice of you to stop by. My name is Kevin. I live and study in the beautiful city of Dortmund, Germany. It is a place well-known for good football and beer. I like to write code, especially in Python and C++. Haskell is nice as well but sometimes a bit over my head. If you want to know, what I'm up to, why not have a look at my <a href="https://github.com/kdungs">GitHub profile</a>. You could also read <a href="/about.html">something about this website or myself</a> or one of my recent ramblings listed below.
